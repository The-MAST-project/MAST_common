"""Resolving an object name to J2000.

No network: Sesame and TNS are both replaced. What is pinned is the order of enquiry, the
refusals, the provenance, and the budget -- the things a wrong answer would be silent
about.

The case worth stating plainly: a misresolution is indistinguishable from success at every
layer below this. The mount slews normally, guiding locks, and a spectrum is taken of the
wrong object. So "which service answered" is not decoration, and neither is refusing a
name that cannot have a fixed position.

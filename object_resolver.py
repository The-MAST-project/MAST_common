"""Resolve an object name to J2000 coordinates.

Standalone by design. The consumers are a plan sweeper (fill in a target that has a name
but no coordinates, and record them), `mount/goto_object`, and eventually
`unit/start_acquisition_and_guiding`, which takes J2000 only today. None of them are
wired here.

Two serial gates, then every service at once.

The **gates** decide whether to touch the network at all, and both are free:

1. **Moving targets are refused without a network call.** Comets and minor planets have
   no fixed J2000 -- only an ephemeris at an instant -- so a plausible answer would be
   worse than none. Refusing by pattern also stops such a name reaching a catalogue that
   might match it for unrelated reasons.
2. **Cache.**

Past them, **TNS, Sesame/CDS and Sesame/CfA are asked simultaneously**. Nothing is asked
speculatively -- the gates already decided -- but once the decision is made there is no
reason for one service to queue behind another. Two rules govern who wins:

* The **Sesame mirrors race**; first positive answer wins. They are interchangeable, so
  that is not a shortcut but the correct reading of "whichever answers first". A miss from
  one is not the verdict -- only when every mirror says no is the miss definitive, and a
  definitive miss is the one failure this module may remember.
* **TNS is preferred, not raced.** For a TNS-shaped name (`AT`/`SN` + year) its verdict is
  awaited before Sesame's is looked at. Taking whoever answers soonest would be WRONG:
  Sesame is the faster of the two, so first-wins would systematically prefer the staler
  source for exactly the names TNS exists to answer. A TNS miss or outage falls through --
  a name that merely looks like a transient may be an older object Sesame knows -- and
  because Sesame was started at the same instant, falling through costs nothing.

This was sequential until 2026-08-26, and the arrangement hid a fallback that could not
work. With the mirrors tried in turn behind TNS, the per-mirror cap had to be 4s to fit the
budget -- but measured over 20 minutes from mast00, the CfA mirror's FASTEST response was
9.27s (median 9.59s, and a third of responses near 20.5s). CDS answers in 1.97s. So the
fallback existed in the code and never once in reality, and the cost of finding that out
was borne by whoever was on shift when CDS refused a query.

A note on why TNS is preferred, since the reasoning was wrong at first and the correction
matters: it is NOT that Sesame returns a transient's host galaxy instead of the transient.
Measured on 2026-08-12, SIMBAD gives SN2023ixf its own position, 4.39 arcmin from M101's
nucleus. The real gap is recency -- a transient reported last night is in TNS and not yet
in SIMBAD -- so Sesame's failure mode for a fresh transient is "not found", which is loud
and safe. That is a weaker argument for TNS-first than the one originally recorded in
MAST_common#60, and it is why falling through to Sesame is correct rather than dangerous.

Every result carries where it came from. A misresolution is indistinguishable from a
correct one at every layer below this -- the mount slews normally, guiding locks, and a
spectrum is taken of the wrong object -- so the provenance is the only way to work out
afterwards why a night pointed where it did.

    """Ask TNS for a transient's own position. None if TNS has no such object.

    Verified against the live service on 2026-08-23, once bot credentials existed:
    `SN 2023ixf` came back at 14.06071h +54.31165, which is the published position to
    0.6" in RA and 0.2" in Dec, and `AT 2024gy` came back as `SN2024gy` -- TNS returning
    the promoted prefix for a transient since classified, which is the reason TNS is
    asked before Sesame for these names.

    The marker is the part to get right, and it fails in a way that points at the wrong
    thing. TNS enforces it only when it parses as a bot identity: omit it, or malform it,
    and the request succeeds. A well-formed marker naming a bot the key does not belong
    to gives `401 Unauthorized` with no detail -- the same response as a garbage key. So
    a 401 here means the `tns_id`/`bot_name` in the vault disagree with the key at least
    as often as it means the key is bad; check those before suspecting the key. Do not
    "fix" a 401 by dropping the marker: TNS requires bots to identify themselves, and an
    unmarked client is the one that gets rate-limited.
